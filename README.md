## Introduction:

A repo covering the core concepts of VueJS (2).

## Core

A `framework` used to create `JS driven apps` for the `web`. As its based on JS, pages run into the browser. This makes it somewhat similar to React and Angular.

What makes it different from them is:

- It only takes up `16kb on production version` so its lightweight/lean and `loads quickly`
- It has a very `high run-time performance`
- Although being lean and performant, it maintains a lot of features like `components, filters, forms, data bindings, etc`
